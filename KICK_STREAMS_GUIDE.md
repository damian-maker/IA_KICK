# üéÆ Kick Streams - Complete Guide

## The 403 Forbidden Issue

Kick.com streams are **protected** and require proper authentication to access. When you try to access a Kick stream URL directly, you'll get:

```
HTTP error 403 Forbidden
Server returned 403 Forbidden (access denied)
```

This is **normal and expected** - Kick protects their streams from direct access.

## Solution: yt-dlp

**yt-dlp** is a powerful tool that handles authentication for protected streams, including Kick.com.

### Installation

```bash
pip install yt-dlp
```

That's it! The application will automatically use yt-dlp when processing Kick URLs.

### How It Works

1. You provide a Kick channel URL: `https://kick.com/channelname`
2. The application detects it's a Kick URL
3. yt-dlp extracts the authenticated stream URL
4. The application processes the stream normally

### Supported URL Formats

‚úÖ **Kick Channel URL** (Recommended):
```
https://kick.com/channelname
```

‚úÖ **Kick Video URL**:
```
https://kick.com/video/12345
```

‚ùå **Direct Stream URL** (Won't work):
```
https://stream.kick.com/ivs/v1/.../master.m3u8
```
*These require the original page URL for authentication*

## Quick Start

### 1. Install yt-dlp

```bash
pip install yt-dlp
```

### 2. Verify Installation

```bash
yt-dlp --version
```

Should show version number (e.g., `2024.10.07`)

### 3. Test with a Kick Stream

```bash
python test_stream_url.py "https://kick.com/channelname"
```

### 4. Process the Stream

**GUI Mode:**
```bash
python main.py --gui
```
Enter the Kick channel URL in the interface.

**CLI Mode:**
```bash
python main.py --url "https://kick.com/channelname" --generate-clips
```

## Troubleshooting

### ‚ùå "yt-dlp not found"

**Problem**: yt-dlp is not installed

**Solution**:
```bash
pip install yt-dlp
```

Verify:
```bash
yt-dlp --version
```

### ‚ùå "Direct stream URLs from Kick require the original page URL"

**Problem**: You're using a direct `.m3u8` URL instead of the channel URL

**Solution**: Use the channel URL instead:
- ‚ùå `https://stream.kick.com/.../master.m3u8`
- ‚úÖ `https://kick.com/channelname`

### ‚ùå "Channel is not currently live"

**Problem**: The channel is offline

**Solution**:
- Check if the channel is actually streaming
- Try a different channel that's currently live
- For VODs, use the video URL format

### ‚ùå "yt-dlp extraction failed"

**Problem**: yt-dlp couldn't extract the stream

**Possible causes**:
1. Channel is offline
2. Stream is geo-restricted
3. Kick changed their format
4. Network issues

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Test yt-dlp directly
yt-dlp -F "https://kick.com/channelname"

# Update yt-dlp
pip install --upgrade yt-dlp

# Check if stream works in browser
# Open the Kick URL in your browser
```

## Advanced Usage

### Check Stream Info with yt-dlp

```bash
# List available formats
yt-dlp -F "https://kick.com/channelname"

yt-dlp "https://kick.com/channelname"
```
